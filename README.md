# The Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton invented in 1970 by the homonymous British mathematician. The aim of the game was to show how natural behaviours like birth, growth and dead of living organisms, who interact with each other in a common ennvironment, can be described with mathematical models.
This game is a zero-player game: the user only has to provide the initial state and this state evolves based on simple rules.
